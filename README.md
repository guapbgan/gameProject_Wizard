# gameProject_Wizard
This is a project of C# development course. The main idea is about drawing and acting, and the player could doodle a specific pattern to attack enemy, heal himself and so on.
This project chooses SQL to save player's data and uses BPN to recognize the pattern which is drawn by player. The BPN has four layers, and there are one input layer which contains 400 nodes, two hidden layers which contain five nodes and one output layer which contains five nodes.
